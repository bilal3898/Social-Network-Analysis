Social Network Analysis Overview
This project leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze social networks and extract meaningful insights from their structure and relationships. 
By applying advanced machine learning techniques, the project aims to perform tasks such as node classification, link prediction, community detection, 
and personalized recommendations within a social network.

Features
Graph Neural Network Implementation:
   Models used: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and GraphSAGE.
Node Classification:
Predict user profiles and assign nodes to specific communities based on their properties and relationships.
Link Prediction:
Identify potential future connections or interactions within the social network.
Visualization:
Interactive visualization of social network structures, communities, and user embeddings.
Web Application Deployment:
A user-friendly web interface for analyzing and visualizing social network insights.
